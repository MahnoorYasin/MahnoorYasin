Hello! My name is Mahnoor Yasin, and I am currently a student at the Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute (GIKI), where I am pursuing my studies in Artificial Intelligence. I have a strong passion for AI research and am deeply enthusiastic about undertaking AI projects that allow me to explore and contribute to the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence.

My skills include proficiency in programming languages like C++ and Python, which I leverage to develop and implement AI solutions. While I have knowledge in machine learning, my particular interest lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I find the intricacies of understanding and processing human language fascinating, and I am eager to delve deeper into this area to uncover new insights and applications.

Outside of academics, I actively seek opportunities to apply my knowledge practically, whether through personal projects or collaborations. I am motivated by the potential of AI to solve real-world problems and improve everyday processes. My goal is to continue expanding my expertise in AI, contribute meaningfully to the field, and ultimately make a positive impact through innovation and technology.
